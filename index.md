## Introduction
I'm the s0cm0nkey. I am a security analyst, threat hunter, pentester, researcher, and CTF enthusiast. By day, I run a SOC team and teach cyber security. By night, I play CTFs, hack things, and eat a professional volume of tacos. Ping me any time. I love to talk about all things security. 

My main ongoing project is the Security Reference guide. I love teaching cyber security and all its facets so I started  building a huge resource collection to help point new cyber defenders in the right direction.
Check it out for all the best tools, links, references, and everything!

## Blue Team Tools
Here are a couple of tools for network defenders to make looking up indicators and threat objects easier if they dont have any automation to leverage. While incorporation into a platform is always preferable, sometimes its just faster and easier to go directly to the public web gui of a tool and parse its output. This should help with that. Props to Michael Bazzel from OSINTtechniques for the inspiration from his own toolset.

## Pentest/Bug Bounty Tools
This tool is great for the passive recon phase of a Pentest and bug bounty. The main goal was to have no interaction with your target, and to avoid the CLI.
